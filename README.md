# CART Visualizations and Replication

This repository contains the supplementary material for a project on Classification Trees. The project comprises the creation of a website introducing the topic at a level suitable for end-of-bachelor students who wish to learn more about classical machine learning models, as well as a more in-depth paper on the mathematical theory behind Classification Trees and their application to a self-chosen dataset. The corresponding fU:stat website article is yet to be published (as of September 2025).

## Repository Contents

- **CART Visualizations:** Code for all visualizations, as included in the corresponding website article.  
- **Auxiliary Website:** Supporting website used for presenting the website article. 
- **Replication Code:** All code implementations replicating the results of the accompanying paper.
