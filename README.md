# CART Visualizations and Replication

This repository contains the supplementary material for a project on Classification Trees. The project comprises the creation of a website introducing the topic at a level suitable for end-of-bachelor students who wish to learn more about classical machine learning models, as well as a more in-depth paper on the mathematical theory behind Classification Trees and their application to a self-chosen dataset. The corresponding fu:stat website article is yet to be published (as of September 2025).

## Repository Contents

- **Website Figures:** Code for all visualizations included in the corresponding fu:stat website article.  
- **Auxiliary Website:** HTML website supporting the presentation of the article.  
- **Replication Code:** Code implementations replicating the results of the accompanying paper.

## Getting Started
